create a super in depth schema for the filters dict

test the whole thing (with the api, pulling the )


Given the following code that loads

campsites       "attributes": [                 # Attributes of the campsite
        [
          "string",                   # Name of the attribute
          bool or string or int       # Value of the attribute
        ]


    "activities": [  # List of activities available at the campground
    "string"
],
"amenities": [  # List of amenities available at the campground
    "string"
],


Add llm (have chatgpt make the schema)
Review carefully the code for react and how it works
Finish the site






for file in src/App.js src/CampgroundList.js src/App.css src/CampgroundList.css src/components/SearchForm.js src/index.js; do echo -e "\n====== $file ======\n"; cat "$file"; done



# check if the llm works to get info (how to format, structured out)
# add in the dynamic grabbing of info about the stuff nearby

# look at camply and figure out how it works
# host it so I can provide list of campsites or campground and date and get a list of ones available on that date
# OR
# give a date and an email and a set of campgrounds/sites and message them when one is open
# get to the point where we have an api that 
#     1. gives a set of campsites or campground (based on a bunch of filter inputs and text with model, etc)
#     2. the ability to see only available or both and select to be notified






IDEA: random sample stats from campsite attrs etc and then use llm to make statement in text requesting campsite with those things 
add all of the possibilities to structured output for searching





Your goal is to make a very nice looking website that makes calls to an api and displays the results in a nice format.  The long comments etc do not need to all be returned, the availability for each campsite should be returned and campsites should be nested under each campground.  I should be able to search the site like kayak or google flights and get a set of campgrounds, then when I click the campground it doesn't open a new page but instead expands that block to show the set of campsites and the days they are available.  Give each file needed to make the website and tell me where to put them (and any setup or installation steps needed) to be able to see the site in my local browser.

I am able to call locally like this:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/filter-campgrounds -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
      "availability": {
        "start_window_date": "2024-11-07", 
        "end_window_date": "2024-11-11", 
        "num_nights": 2, 
        "days_of_the_week": [4, 5]
      },
      "filters": {
        "AND": [
          {"rating.average_rating": {"gt": 3.5}},
          {"rating.number_of_ratings": {"gt": 200}},
          {"location": {"within_radius": {"center": [37.759244, -122.451855], "radius": 170}}}
        ]
      },
      "sort": {
        "key": "rating.average_rating",
        "reverse": true
      }
    }'


and get something like this:

I have a few comments about things that could be improved, but I first want to say what a wonderful experience this was for me and my family. The ability to take my kids on their first backpacking trip, but still have a toilet and water nearby made it a wonderful first step. The stars were unlike anything my kids have seen before, the cool weather (when it was 110 in the valley) was so welcomed, and it was a memorable experience for all with the kids already talking about doing it again next year. \n\nFor the improvements:\nWe had poison oak in our camp. Not just along a path somewhere which you can\u2019t control, but actually within arms reach of our tent spot. I think the park service could do better here.  Luckily we identified it and avoided it, but I\u2019m quite sure others staying in this campsite would not have been so lucky. Our site #005 on Coast was nice and secluded, but our tent area smelled of urine. I guess when your site is nice and secluded people don\u2019t bother walking to the bathroom. \nThe stinging nettles were unavoidable on the trails with all of us being stung many times. Again I assume nettles off the path, but I would expect the park to be better about clearing the actual trail of these. \nFinally the overgrowth of the trail in general was a bit much. We were already cautious of ticks and wanted to avoid wading through grass, but parts of the trail were so overgrown that the grass was above our heads and we were pushing through it. Kids joked about needing a machete.  I\u2019m just happy no one had any ticks. We had to check several times to be sure. \n\nAgain, big picture was a wonderful and memorable experience. We will be back. I just think there a few things that should have been better maintained.","upvote_score":0},{"campsite_id":"79026","campsite_name":"006","campsite_reserved_date":"2024-07-09T00:00:00Z","created_at":"2024-07-18T14:32:23.053272531Z","rating":2,"review":"Only the Sky Trail, which is an access road, was maintained.

My husband and I both got a little bit of stinging nettle, we hadn\u2019t known what it looked like previously, and we were  careful to avoid it later. \nThe following day we decided to move our car to the Sky trail head parking lot, we hiked down using the horse trail. Again, the trail was over grown, not maintained,  and barely visible at times. Again, I was scared of the occurrence of ticks. On the horse trail we had to be more vigilant to avoid the poison oak and stinging nettle, there was more on this trail than on the Meadow Trail. \nWe had hoped to hike down to the beach, but all of the trails seemed too dangerous due to lack of maintenance.  \nWe had our two sons with us and we are trying to teach them how to appreciate and respect the outdoors and public parks.

Only accessibility problem for me was opening the bear box latch in camp! Almost impossible without the physical aid of a particular size of rock to stick up into latch. Otherwise everything plenty accessible if no mobility issues. Not accessible for wheelchairs. Lots of ways in to Coast Camp - long and steep from Visitors Center over Mt Wittenberg and down Woodward Valley trail,  to easy short and flat via Coast trail from the Limantour Road hostel turnoff. Or even shorter walk over beach from Limantour parking lot - easy walking if sand is wet and firm but a tiring plod with a pack if sand is dry, so depends on tide.  Bathroom and water spigot are very far from sites 1-7 (esp 7) which are up a steep hill and nice private sites. Quarter mi roundtrip walk to bathroom from #5. Stayed two nights at Coast Camp #5 followed by two nights at WIldcat Camp #6. Beautiful trip. Cold winter evenings are fine with lots of wool and down layers! One big rain and wind day at Wildcat. Bear box latches in sites are now so stiff (rusty?) that they're very hard to open and close, even the newer ones at Coast. (Wildcat's new bear boxes are about to be installed, currently all in a pile near the bathrooms). Had to put a medium-size stone up inside the latch cover and push IT against the latch mechanism. Large guy-hands might do ok.\n\nAmazing high and low tides because January + new moon! Luckily this time the low-low tide was in afternoon rather than middle of night. So at Coast Camp I was able to get all the way to \"Secret beach no. 2\"!  Requires a minus tide. From Sculptured Beach to SBno.1 climb up onto an outcrop (easy, almost steplike access), then around it to the cliffside, and then a trickier but short climb straight down a 'corner' notch to the sand.  (On my way back, I couldn't climb back up the same way - shoes too slippery to hold on the first slanted foothold - but turns out to be an easy short climb up the nice curved shoulder of the outcrop, tons of handholds and footholds. That way is harder to see from above though, so would probably still use the straight notch for coming down.)\n\nThen walk behind next outcrop and you have access (at low tide) to get through either a minus tide walk-thru arch or a higher crawl-through tunnel over to Secret Beach #1. Secret Beach #2 has the Hole-in-the-ceiling cave! Right there as soon as you get onto that 2nd beach (yet another arch-tunnel, then - only at a minus tide - you can get over some rough tidepool rocks to the beach). The cave has a lowish rock entrance but inside is a huge round interior in the soft cliff material open to sky! Awe-inspiring. Beautiful beach with great layered strata in cliffs. Leave enough time to get back before incoming tide blocks way.","upvote_score":0},{"campsite_id":"79498","campsite_name":"004","campsite_reserved_date":"2023-12-30T00:00:00Z","created_at":"2024-01-04T00:02:21.980457439Z","rating":5,"review":"Parking right at the trailhead, and very quick/easy hike-in to the campsite.
